It asks whether it is possible to reject the idea of vanity in such a society, and highlights the average young womanâ€™s experience of vanity from childhood through to early adulthood. How does oneâ€™s perception of self-change throughout these integral life stages? You will be taken through three life stages, and how you choose to experience each of these is up to you.

Instead, you waited patiently until your eighth birthday. Now, you could shop at Diva for the same colourful, spiky ball earrings that the other girls wore. You had always wanted a jewellery box like your mother, and final, you were gifted one to keep all your earrings safe. It was Bratz themed, obviously, because that was your favourite show growing up and your father would help burn the DVD movies borrowed form Blockbuster so you could watch them over and over. You wished to grow up quickly, and be just like those four best friendsâ€”dress like them, carry around a flip phone like them, have long hair like them.

The girls all had Build-a-Bears, dressed in tiny clothes and tiny shoes. Their fur was soft and untainted. Your favourite teddy was gifted to you at six months old, on your first Christmas. His fur was not soft, but all matted from one to many washes thanks to a couple bouts of gastro. He didnâ€™t have any clothes or shoes, and your have to push the clumpy fur from his plastic eyes to reveal them. When you learnt to read, you reinstated his given name, Theodore, declared by his tag. Your parents let you get a Build-a-Bear of your own for your birthday one year, so that you could dress it up for the teddy bear picnics like the other girls did.

Your mother did your makeup like the older girls wore itâ€”foundation, lipstick, eyelinerâ€”and you got to wear a tutu like you had always wanted (you were disappointed to find that ballerinas did not wear tutus to every dance class). You had your photo taken on rehearsal day, but you donâ€™t like how you look in itâ€”your hands arenâ€™t graceful enough and your mother had sewn the elastic straps of the leotard backwards, so they sat too close together at the front and farther apart at the back. 

[[back to contents|contentschildhood]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="birthdays p.1" tags="text" position="50,800" size="100,100">Every year you were getting closer to being like the teenage girls you admired so much. You were excited to turn five years old (a whole hand!) and ten years old (two whole hands!). Every year, your grandfather would supply a birthday cake, layered with jam and cream, the top iced with â€˜Happy Birthdayâ€™ and your name. To your demise, however, your birthday always fell on school holidays, so you never got to wear the birthday hat all the other kids at school did. Regardless, your closest friends came to your birthday party at six and ten years old, and you were always spoiled by family.

Not fake ones, but real. You wanted to be a fairy, and Santa could give you anything you wanted, right? You mother knew how much you loved fairies, and so when you were too nervous to go to school, she bought you a key ring with a fairy encased in resin to keep in the pocket of your school dress with the promise that the fairy would watch over you. 

[[back to contents|contentschildhood]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="possession comparison p.2" tags="text" position="175,750" size="100,100">Your mother kept an album from her childhood and adolescence which held photos and records of the horses sheâ€™d had growing up. They were all so beautiful, and her notes meticulous. You started going to holiday programs at a equestrian centre, and soon, group lessons. You were jealous of the girls you knew with their own horses. But you gave up on your dream once you grew up and became too self-critical and depressed to continue your hobby. 

[[back to contents|contentschildhood]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="love? p.1" tags="text" position="775,1000" size="100,100">At thirteen, your biggest desire was to get marriedâ€”you dreamed up the whole thing; dress, location, decorations. You swore that the moment you turned eighteen would marry. But the boys in school did not pay much attention to you, except for oneâ€”but he was just a friend. He messaged you one day after school, asking you if youâ€™d go out with him. Your face had gone bright red with the shock of it. You politely declinedâ€”and good thing too. The following message informed him it was a prank, and that another of the boys at the bus bay had dared him to do it. Of course it was! You feel undesired, and this proves it so. 

[[back to contents|contentsadolescence]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="self-perception p.3" tags="text" position="700,1125" size="100,100">You are stalking your younger sister on Instagram at a sleepover with your best friend. It is a startling realisation that, though two years your junior, she is cooler than you. Her posts are much more like the ones you see your favourite influencers posting, and the ones you see on Tumblr. You and your best friend make a planâ€”you will emerge, rightfully, as the cooler, older sister, in due time. 

[[back to contents|contentsadolescence]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="outside-perception p.1" tags="text" position="525,1000" size="100,100">A girl in your grade has a blog, which she promotes through an Instagram page. She is so pretty, and everybody likes her. You want to be like her, but you donâ€™t want anyone to know that. So, as anyone else would do, you start a blog and create an Instagram page separate from your personal one. You put on your best skinny jeans and crop top, and get your friend to take pictures of you standing in a patch of daisies you find outside your old kindergarten. A man unknown to you sends a private message, asking to see your breasts. You are fourteen years old. You are frightened by the picture he sends you. You block him, and quickly delete your profile, abandon all ambition. Better not being perceived at all than gaining and alarming awareness of the way that certain, perverted people will look at you. 

[[back to contents|contentsadolescence]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="self-perception p.4" tags="text" position="575,1125" size="100,100">You are still waiting for your boobs to grow. The other girls talk about their bra sizes, and you meekly tell them youâ€™re an A cup. They arenâ€™t lankyâ€”their hips are widening, and they look athletic in their sports uniforms. You make a list, every night, in your head of the parts of yourself you hate. You vow that when you are old enough, you will get a nose job. You do not like how big yours is and want a button nose like the women in movies. You find out about labiaplasties. You refuse to wear heels because you are taller than anyone else as it is. 

[[back to contents|contentsadolescence]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="love? p.2" tags="text" position="400,1000" size="100,100">You get your braces off one day and get back to school for lunch time. While standing in line for the canteen, a boy you are friends with stands with you. You tell him excitedly that you got your braces off and flash him a smile. He tells you your teeth look beautiful, then corrects himself; tells you that youâ€™re beautiful. You realise and tell him that no one has said that to you before. You memorise your phone number because you think that maybe your crush will finally ask you out. 

[[back to contents|contentsadolescence]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="love? p. 3" tags="text" position="650,1000" size="100,100">You start talking to a boy from your best friendâ€™s school, and he becomes your boyfriend soon enough. He sometimes asks you to do things you are not comfortable with, and youâ€™re not sure you like him so much after all. He pays attention to you though, and he obviously likes you enough to have asked you out. WRONG! He breaks up with you after two months because he prefers you as a friend. You call your best friend and she pretty much just says good riddance â€˜cause he cheated on you, and you believe it, because wouldnâ€™t that make so much more sense than a boy actually being interested in you as a person when you look the way you do. You cry because you thought you were good enough for a while, and now thatâ€™s gone. You donâ€™t cry because you liked him.

You watch their makeup routines and look up on Google ways to get rid of freckles. You wish your skin was a smooth and single colour like theirs. You think they look prettier and that their makeup applies better.

After graduating high school, you and your friends download Tinder. They get more messages than you do. You donâ€™t tell them that. You talk to a boy and eventually, meet up with him. You never see him again, but he replies to a picture on your story of your sister, asking who it was with a little heart eye emoji. You tell him thatâ€™s your little sister. He realises his mistake. You think that your sister is prettier than you from then on and doubt your lovability. Months later, he sends you a picture of a friends Tinder profile in which you make an appearance in one of the photos. He tells you to tell your friend that he thinks theyâ€™re super-hot. God forbid the man who took your v-card has manners and keeps his attraction to your family and friends to himself. Never mind his attraction to youâ€”that doesnâ€™t seem to matter, or exist.

You never did end up getting that nose job when you turned eighteen, because you wanted to rebel against the societal beauty standards. Also, because you saw on TikTok how a nose job is performed, and it was kind of barbaric. Really, it was less rebelling but talking yourself out of it because taking a chisel and hammer to your face seemed less than ideal.

When your sister is 18, she gets the surgery your orthodontist had been adamant you get when you were 18. But you were too afraid. After 6 months, the swelling has gone down. You look at pictures from before and see how much her face has changed. Because sisters are put against each other and compared, you now wish you had done itâ€”you feel like the ugly sister. You reckon thatâ€™s what everyone thinks about you. You get tired, having considered the procedure for 5 years, and book an appointment with the orthodontist. You worry that, because you want the procedure for vain reasons, rather than the functional and preventative benefits, something bad might happen. The first person you tell about this thing thatâ€™s eating away at you is your lover, who tells you that youâ€™re crazy, you donâ€™t need it to look beautiful, but that heâ€™ll support you anyway.

Somehow, you manage to trick yourself into falling in love. You push aside the fear of rejection and heartbreak, for hope of happiness, and it sticks. Sometimes you are struck by deep and philosophical thoughts, which you send to him because he understands these things more than anyone. You tell him one day that you like to have a secret in the back of your mind. You tell him that it makes you feel powerful, because even if somebody thinks you are ugly, they donâ€™t know what you hide. It is like deception, you think; to have people think you unattractive but really, they donâ€™t know a thing about you.

Your lover tells you that youâ€™re the most feminine girl he has ever dated. You doubt him, but he explains rebuts, says the way you act is feminine, and that youâ€™re beautiful. You meet his ex-girlfriend at a party. She was nice at first, but you grew to hate her. She is the definition of femininity and exudes sexual energy. You feel obsolete, but your lover does not accept the cigarette she attempts to place in his mouth from between her dainty fingers. He makes no comment when she asks him where the loaf of sourdough he promised to bake her mother is. The next day, you buy press on nails, sparkly lip gloss, and a new coat, so maybe you can be that bit more feminine like her. You spend hours stalking her on Instagram. You struggle to watch Game of Thrones when Myrcella appears on screen, because she is blonde and beautiful, soft and feminine like his ex.

On your nineteenth birthday, you end up having kick-ons at your house. Everything closed early due to COVID restrictions. In the early hours of the morning, it is just you and two other friends, one of them a supervisor at your fast-food job. He has a girlfriend but tells you how lucky any man would be to have you. You donâ€™t feel safe in your body after he places a hand on your thigh, when no one was around, complimenting your pants. You tell him thanks and where you got them from. His hand slides further up your thigh. You donâ€™t feel safe in your body for a while after that. The belief you had, that it wouldnâ€™t happen to you, has dissolved. You feel weak, because you hadnâ€™t stopped him, even though it made you sick, and because you are so angry and upset about an act that could have been much worse.

You begin adulthood with short hair. You hate itâ€”you wanted it shoulder length, not chin, but the lady at Just Cuts had started at the back of your head, where you couldnâ€™t see it. You grow it out, get a shag, which you like. Then Phil at the salon gets a little carried you and you end up with a mullet. You never go back to Phil. People had told you before, youâ€™d look good with a mullet, but your femininity is sapped. Your mumâ€™s hairdresser fixes itâ€”itâ€™s short but more feminine. You vow to never cut your hair long again. In fact, you want your hair longer that it ever has been. 

[[back to contents|contentsadulthood]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="reflections" tags="text" position="925,1200" size="100,100">So, what does //On Vanity and the Art of Comparison// tell us? Perhaps that, if you observe, as all humans do, the people around you, you are bound to feel lesser - less beautiful, less feminine, less worthy. I expected to come to some bright, life-changing idea at the end of this exploration, but I didn&#39;t. Perhaps you have. 

Everybody is always trying to stop caring what everybody else thinks, to love ourselves. I think in order to stop caring, you have to eradicate all negative thoughts of yourself, because then, you won&#39;t even become aware of the negative things people could be thinking about you, which they probably aren&#39;t. 

I gave away a lot of my clothes the first and only time I fell in love. I realised that a lot of the things I bought and wore were not things I chose for myself, but instead based on assumptions of what other people had expected me to wear. The coat I bought after that house-party isn&#39;t me. The red shoes I bought, because red is sexy and cool, are not me. I can be beautiful without possession definining beauty for me. I want to be a lot of things - more empathetic, quieter, calmer, less depressed, better at public speaking - but I feel that this also enters into the realm of vanity and comparison. It&#39;s not a physical type of vanity, but one assigned to that of personality. If I want to be these things, is it only to save myself from judgement of others?

There is no simple answer that I know of yet, to resist the shine of beauty and grace, but I am young still. I have time to figure it out.
